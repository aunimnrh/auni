	<p style="text-align: justify; background-color: skyblue; font-family: candara; font-size: 20px;"> The age 20 is where people will see you as an adult as the word 'teen' has been gone in your age number. In my 20 years of life, I have been experiencing many things from since I was still a little child until I am a beautiful grown woman. One of the experiences that I remember is that I had the opportunity to visit Mecca and had my first Umrah since I was still a kid which I was very thankful for. Besides that, getting my drivers licennse is another experience that I can remember. I attended the class alone and was very nervous driving cars for the first time. My parents supported me in taking my motorcycles licence too which I think is super hard but I nailed it. It was an experince that will forever be memorable to me. Besides that, I am very experienced in making posters for programs that are held at colleges. It was an experience I never knew was very fun and great to look back at. Last but not least, I have experience in working as a barista at a local coffee shop. It was one of my dreams to be able to work a part time at a cafe.  </p>
